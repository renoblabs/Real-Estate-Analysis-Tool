## Understanding the Analysis

### Deal Score (A-F Grade)

Your deal receives a score out of 100 points based on:

- **Cash Flow** (30 points): Monthly positive/negative cash flow
- **Cash-on-Cash Return** (25 points): Annual return on invested capital
- **Cap Rate** (20 points): Compared to market benchmarks
- **DSCR** (15 points): Debt Service Coverage Ratio
- **Stress Test** (10 points): OSFI B-20 compliance

#### Grade Meanings:

- **A (85-100)**: Excellent deal - pursue aggressively
- **B (70-84)**: Good deal - worth considering
- **C (55-69)**: Fair deal - analyze carefully
- **D (40-54)**: Below average - proceed with caution
- **F (0-39)**: Poor deal - pass unless special circumstances

### Key Metrics Explained

#### Cap Rate (Capitalization Rate)
```
Cap Rate = Net Operating Income ÷ Purchase Price × 100
```
- Measures property's return independent of financing
- Compare against local market averages
- Higher = better (generally 4-7% in Canadian markets)

#### Cash-on-Cash Return
```
CoC Return = Annual Cash Flow ÷ Total Cash Invested × 100
```
- Measures return on your actual money invested
- Target: 8-12% for good deals
- Considers leverage (mortgage) effects

#### DSCR (Debt Service Coverage Ratio)
```
DSCR = Net Operating Income ÷ Annual Debt Service
```
- Measures ability to cover mortgage payments
- Lenders want 1.15-1.25 minimum
- Below 1.0 = negative cash flow

#### Gross Rent Multiplier
```
GRM = Purchase Price ÷ Annual Rent
```
- Quick property valuation metric
- Lower = better value
- Compare to similar properties

### Cash Flow Breakdown

#### Net Operating Income (NOI)
- Gross rent - Operating expenses (excluding mortgage)
- Used for cap rate and property value calculations

#### Cash Flow
- NOI - Mortgage payments
- Your actual monthly/annual profit or loss

### Warnings & Red Flags

The platform automatically flags potential issues:

- ⚠️ **Negative Cash Flow**: Property loses money monthly
- ⚠️ **Low DSCR**: Insufficient income to cover debt
- ⚠️ **High Vacancy Assumption**: >10% vacancy rate
- ⚠️ **Fails Stress Test**: Won't qualify under OSFI rules
- ⚠️ **Below Market Cap Rate**: Overpriced compared to area

## Tips & Best Practices

### Getting Accurate Results

1. **Be Conservative**: Overestimate expenses, underestimate rent
2. **Real Numbers**: Use actual quotes for insurance, property tax
3. **Market Rent**: Research comparable rentals in the area
4. **Vacancy Rate**: Use local data (5-8% is typical)
5. **Maintenance**: Budget 1-1.5% of property value annually

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Forgetting Expenses**
- Utilities if you pay them
- Lawn care, snow removal
- Common area maintenance (condos)
- Reserve fund contributions

❌ **Underestimating Maintenance**
- HVAC repairs
- Roof replacement
- Plumbing, electrical
- Appliance replacement

❌ **Ignoring Vacancy**
- Tenant turnover
- Maintenance periods
- Market slowdowns

❌ **Overlooking Closing Costs**
- Land transfer tax (biggest!)
- Legal fees
- Home inspection
- Title insurance
- Appraisal fees

### Deal Analysis Workflow

1. **Quick Screen**: Run initial analysis
2. **Refine Inputs**: Get actual quotes and numbers
3. **Sensitivity Analysis**: Test different scenarios
4. **Compare**: Stack against other opportunities
5. **Due Diligence**: Property inspection, market research
6. **Final Analysis**: Make offer decision

### Using Different Strategies

#### Buy & Hold
- Focus on cash flow and cap rate
- Target: Positive cash flow + market appreciation
- Best for: Long-term wealth building

#### BRRRR
- Ensure ARV is realistic (use appraisals)
- Budget 1.5x your renovation estimate
- Calculate refinance based on 75-80% ARV
- Goal: Recover most/all initial capital

#### Fix & Flip
- Conservative sale price estimates
- Include holding costs (mortgage, tax during reno)
- Factor in realtor fees (5%) and closing costs
- Timeline: Longer = more expensive
