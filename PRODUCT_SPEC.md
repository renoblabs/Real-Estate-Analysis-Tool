## **Product Specification v1.0**
### *"Built by investors, for investors"*

## **🎯 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

**Problem:** Canadian real estate investors use fragmented tools (Realtor.ca + spreadsheets + Zillow + random calculators) that don't talk to each other, miss Canadian-specific regulations, and ignore the regulatory arbitrage opportunities unique to our market.

**Solution:** All-in-one platform that combines property discovery, financial analysis, regulatory intelligence, and deal execution - specifically designed for Canadian real estate investing nuances.
